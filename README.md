### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Greetings, my name is Moses Kurniawan. I am a semi-fullstack developer, currently residing in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. I am currently employed as a web team leader at @tix-id, the No. 1 cinema, event ticketing purchasing and entertainment app in Indonesia.

My traits are troubleshooter, support/adviser-person rather than leading-person. I can safely say that I am also a [Duct Tape](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/) programmer. The focus is proper but also quick solution. Other than programming, I do computer repair, service and troubleshooting, under **momo computer** personal brand. My other hobbies outside IT is wrist watches and cycling.

I used to be a PHP programmer, since the past ~1 decade. But right now, tools and methodologies were so much different than the past.

I also do design using ~~Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator~~ Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo, but mainly web-focused and image processing that suited for web, not artistic works.

My skills, based on tech stack:

- **PHP** for general-purpose (experienced), with frameworks:
  - CodeIgniter 3 (experienced), 4 (moderate, no longer using)
  - Laravel (experienced, actively used)
  - WordPress (experienced, case by case use)
- **MariaDB/MySQL** for database (experienced) and **PostgreSQL** (moderate)
- **Go/Golang** (moderate, actively used along with PHP)
- **Javascript** (moderate)
- **Vue.js** for frontend web (moderate)
- **Git** for team-based contributions
- **Linux for server administration** (Web server), with Ubuntu. I used to productively using Fedora.
- **Docker+devilbox** for supporting local development environment.
- I use **JIRA** at work and **Trello** for my personal projects.

Despite my tech focus above, it does not mean I am not interested with other tech. In fact, I have great interests and would be great if I can get a chance to work with it.

My skills and my common tasks, based on experiences:

- Building company profile websites, include design. My latest company profile website is [PublicPolicy Asia Advisors](https://www.ppaa.com.sg), a Singapore-based strategic and business advisory firm. My other latest work is [LuckyFox](https://luckyfox.id), a console game accessories provider. Both websites are Wordpress/PHP based.
- Building e-commerce website. My latest e-commerce website is [Play Inc. Store](https://www.playincstore.com) using WordPress. It is a video game e-commerce website.
- Third-party payment integrations, including MidTrans, DOKU Wallet, PayPal.
- Building chat bot. Sending automated messages from LINE mobile client and processing by the server for automated tasks. I currently experimenting with Telegram and WhatsApp.
- Attendant system using QR code.
- Building dashboard administration/control panel for existing running systems. Includes login system, access controls, and actions audit.
- Securing a website, covering the application itself, and the server.
- Manage cloud infrastructure using AWS/Alibaba Cloud.
- Novice skills with Google Firebase. I use Realtime Database for recent project.
- OneSignal integration for push notifications.
