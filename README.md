### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Moses Kurniawan, a semi-fullstack developer based in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. Currently, I serve as a Web Team Leader at [TIX ID](https://www.tix.id), Indonesia's leading platform for cinema, event ticketing, and entertainment.

As a developer, Iâ€™m known for being a reliable troubleshooter and advisor, rather than a conventional leader. I consider myself a [Duct Tape Programmer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/), focused on delivering effective, practical solutions efficiently. In addition to programming, I handle computer repair and troubleshooting under my personal brand, **Momo Computer**. Outside of IT, my interests include wristwatches and cycling.

Over the past decade, my programming background was primarily in PHP, though modern tools and methodologies have significantly evolved since then.

I also have experience in design, working with ~~Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator~~ Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo, specifically in web-focused and image processing tasks rather than artistic works.

### Technical Skills

Hereâ€™s a summary of my skills based on my tech stack:

- **PHP** (experienced), with frameworks:
  - CodeIgniter 3 (proficient) and CodeIgniter 4 (moderate, not in active use)
  - Laravel (actively used)
  - WordPress (case-by-case use)
- **Databases**: MariaDB/MySQL (experienced) and PostgreSQL (moderate)
- **Go/Golang** (moderate, actively used alongside PHP)

- **Linux Server Administration** (primarily Ubuntu; experienced with Fedora in the past)
- **Docker + devilbox** for local development environments

Though these are my primary technical focuses, I am always open to learning and working with other technologies as well.
