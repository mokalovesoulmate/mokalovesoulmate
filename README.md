### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Moses Kurniawan, a semi-fullstack developer based in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. Currently, I serve as a Web Team Leader at [TIX ID](https://www.tix.id), Indonesia's leading platform for cinema, event ticketing, and entertainment.

As a developer, Iâ€™m known for being a reliable troubleshooter and advisor. But I also take leadership role/positions. 

Over the past decade, my programming background was primarily in PHP, though modern tools and methodologies have significantly evolved since then. In addition to programming...

1) I have experience in design. My primary tools are **Affinity Designer** and **Affinity Photo**, specifically in web-focused and image processing tasks rather than artistic works.
2) I have experience in video editing. My primary software is **Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve**. For command-line video processing, I use **FFmpeg**.
3) I have experience in computer repair and troubleshooting under my personal brand, **Momo Computer**. 

Outside of IT, my interests include wristwatches (horology) and cycling.

### Technical Skills

Here is a summary of my skills based on my tech stack:

- **PHP** (experienced), with frameworks:
  - Laravel (current/actively used)
  - Laravel Filament (current/actively used)
  - Plain PHP (case-by-case use)
  - WordPress (case-by-case use)
- **Go/Golang** (actively used alongside PHP)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (preferred), MariaDB/MySQL (for fallbacks/maintaining legacy projects)
- **JavaScript**: Plain JavaScript (experienced) and TypeScript (moderate, as I use Go so much)
- **Vue.js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS** for frontend
- **Git** for team collaboration
- **Linux Server Administration**, primarily Ubuntu (server/desktop), Linux Mint (desktop) but I also operate Fedora.
- **Shell Scripting**: this is my old-fashioned way to do automations.
- **CI/CD**: my experience is only with Jenkins at the moment.
- **Cache and Message Queue**: my experience is only with Redis, DragonFly and RabbitMQ.
- **Docker (OrbStack), Laravel Herd** for local development environments
- Project Management Tools: **JIRA** (work) and **Trello, Notion** (personal projects)
- **AI utilization**: now this is the current trend. I actively using AI as a pair programmer and currently leaning towards agentic AI.

Though these are my primary technical focuses, I am always open to learning and working with other methods/technologies as well.

### Project Experience
